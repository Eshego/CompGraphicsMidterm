The movement was done by me in a previous project adjusted to fit
this style of game as a topdown.

In terms of the shader, I created a toon ramp black to white image 
in photoshop to use as a base structure. I took a texture of metal
for the ship. In the shader I am basically taking a ramp texture and 
adjusting it based off the light in the scene to change how the colour
shifts on the modle. It does this by pulling information from the main texture
finally I multiply the values by a given colour to give off the colour ship I prefer
